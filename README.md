# Optimal Peer Selection for Peer-to-Peer Video Content Distribution using Fuzzy Linear Programming Approach

This repository contains the code implementation for the research article titled "Optimal Peer Selection for Peer-to-Peer Video Content Distribution using Fuzzy Linear Programming Approach". 

Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of fuzzy linear programming to optimize peer selection in peer-to-peer video content distribution networks. The approach is designed to minimize costs and improve efficiency in content distribution.
